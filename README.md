# OrderProcessingSystem

This is a demo project based on Spring + Mybatis.

Execute the .sql file in MySQL, and you will get tables: "user", "orders", "role", "menu", "user_role", "role_menu",which indicate a RABC model.

Basic add, delete, update, load features statements are implemented through Mybatis's Mapper.xml files.

Authentication&Authorization is implemented by SpringSecurity's chain of filters.

User types: Admin & Regular User
